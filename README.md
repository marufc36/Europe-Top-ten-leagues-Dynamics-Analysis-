# Europe-Top-Ten-Leagues-Dynamics-Analysis

**Overview**

This project aims to analyze the dynamics of the top 10 football leagues in Europe using data scraped from [Adam Choi's website](https://www.adamchoi.co.uk/teamgoals/detailed). The dataset includes information on goals scored, goals conceded, matches played, wins, draws, losses, country, and league for each team.



**Dataset**

The dataset is structured with the following columns:

1. Team

2. Goals_Scored

3. Goals_Conceded

4. Matches_Played

5. Wins

6. Draws

7. Losses

8. Country

9. League






**Data Manipulation**

Data manipulation techniques were employed to clean and organize the dataset. This involved handling missing values, converting data types, and ensuring data consistency for accurate analysis.

**Tableau Dashboard**


A Tableau dashboard was created to visually represent key insights from the dataset. The dashboard includes the following analyses:


***1. Highest Scoring Team in Europe***

The visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of team performances across different leagues.Last visualisation give me insights about the thoughest league in Europe based on goal difference . I have created a calculated field from Goal scored and goal goal conceded and named it goal difference.
